## What have I been up to

- I like to drink wine üç∑
- Pascal, Fortran, C (University)
- C Programmer on Unix & Vax VMS
- Java
- Python
- Scala
- Trying to get good at Functional Programming
- Early contributor to ZIO and related projects

![Right 120%](i_know_things.gif)

^- I started life at university and left knowing c
- this lead me to a c programming career working with big enterprise corporations such Mobile networks
- Kind of company that was not built on open source software they would have paid $$$$ for an oracle license & Support contracts mattered to them
- Did as I was told by enterprise world so moved on to learning and using Java with Spring and Hibernate eventually
- After a few years of that Python and got excited that I can write pseudo code for work and get paid. Easy to run, and i get to type a lot less. So I went off to do that
- joint a new company as python developer but within 3 months I was moved to a new team to build a data ingestion pipeline. I chose Scala & Akka for this and my journey of Scala began
- Had no mentor so wrote some idiomatic java scala

## Open Source

![Right 150%](open-source.png)

^- Culture shock
- Searched for a project to contribute to 
- asked questions and got no replies
- Picked issues and got zero help when I had questions
- a lot of conversation amongst themselves but no time for the new contributor
- Saw someone advertising on reddit that they are looking for someone to maintain their project
- I offered to help was kind of shot down by someone who wasn't even part of the project
- End conclusion - contributing to open source is hard!

---

## How ZIO started

![Right 75%](ZIO.png)

^ - John De Goes posts on Twitter asking for 5 contributors for a new project
- 300 expressed an interest
- John sets up a few session to talk through project and gave interests and experience of applicants
- we split into groups based on interest
- Everyone started contributing with the help of John for guidance and amongst themselves within their group.
- Level of contribution was different between each person, and some did drop out and didn't make any contributions

# Contribute to ZIO

- ZIO is a library for asynchronous and concurrent programming that is based on pure functional programming for the Scala programming language.
- Core ZIO Library
- Multiple associated projects which either enhance ZIO features or use ZIO to solve a technical problem
- Have a complete solution using ZIO

![Left 50%](https://shared.softinio.com/Screen-Shot-2020-09-14-21-19-44.18.png)

^- core lib attracts most contributors
- Velocity fast
- I used to be able to keep up with reviewing all PRs. No more!
- Do a quick overview of type of other projects we have: zio-redis, zio-nio, zio-actors, zio-config

---

## Choosing a ZIO Project to contribute too ##

- Visit our organization on GitHub: **_<https://github.com/zio>_**
- Review each projects README and Issue Tracker
- Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `documentation`
- Look for new projects
- Low activity projects
- Projects discord channel 


![Right 50%](https://shared.softinio.com/Screen-Shot-2020-09-14-21-20-14.72.png)

^- Every project have their goals written on README of what they are solving
- Good place to start is by doing a few PRs that are low hanging fruit
- Getting a few PRs done even if it is docs will get you familiar with contributing and help you get known by other contributors
- doing documentation as well as code familiarization gets you to meet other contributors and strick up a relationship
- Something you can build on
- Mention benefits of new projects
- Mention benefits of low active projects and why they may be low active
- Get help in projects discord that you are interested on where to start or to get more info


---

## Starting a new ZIO Project ##


- Contribute a new project to the ZIO eco-system
- Giter8 project seed
	- Code structure
	- Build process and CI
	- Base dependencies and sbt plugins
	- Microsite included !

![Left 70%](zio-giter8.png)

^- You have an idea for lib that would be useful to ZIO ecosystem
- Just minor tokens and GitHub and CI settings to be applied and you are live

## Your new ZIO Project

| ZIO Project| Community Project |
| --- | --- |
| ZIO Org on GitHub | Own Org on GitHub |
| ZIO Org on Maven | Own Org on Maven |
| ZIO Discord Channel | Community Discord Channel[^1] |

![inline fill fit](https://shared.softinio.com/Screen-Shot-2020-09-07-13-53-27.15.png)![inline fill fit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leobenkel/ZparkIO/master/assets/ZparkIO_animated.gif)

[^1]: By invitation only, reviewed on a cases by case only. 

^- two choices of how you start a project
- Community project - your own github/maven org
- still can use discord to get help
- once project established we would consider adding a channel for you under the community project section of discord
- we have had projects start as community then move to zio org
- joining the zio org benefits: increased adoption, increased awareness and more contributors
- use the seed in case you do move later

- https://zio.github.io/zio-actors/

![inline](https://shared.softinio.com/Screen-Shot-2020-09-13-14-01-25.39.png)

^- My first scala job I build a data ingestion pipeline using akka
- inspired me to want to have an implentation of the actor model using ZIO
- I use a project board to set a roadmap and vision for the projects future
- feel free to look to see if anything is appealing to you

---

[.build-lists: false]
### ZIO ZMX ###

![inline](https://shared.softinio.com/Screen-Shot-2020-09-13-14-09-38.17.png)

^- Does have a project board too, but needs updating
- The diagram you see is actually out of date slightly as it doesn't take into account latest changes from contributors

# Lessons Learnt #

- Anyone Can be a contributor
- Focus your library on satisfying user experience and their needs
- Power of the group
- ZIO Community is very welcoming and supportive
- Learn by helping others
- Learn and Gain Experience
- Make a of new friends all around the world
- Microsite CI build will always randomly fail when least expected ü§£

^- I used to think oss was for a small group of elite developers and not for regular developers. ZIO Community showed me anyone can take part
- do your best to figure out the answer to a problem you are working on, but be open to ask for help if you haven't figured it out and be amazed by what we can figure out together as a community
- Welcoming and Supportive which motivates me to want to contribute more

# Thank you #

^- Thank you to John A De Goes and Courtney for the inviting me to talk at Lambdaconf
- I will be publishing an associated blog related to this talk that will include my slides and link to recording when available
